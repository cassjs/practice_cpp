## Description: 
This program evaluates the fuel efficiency of a car by reading the starting/ending mileage and fuel level at trip start/end. The miles traveled, fuel used, and miles per a gallon of fuel is calculated, then these results are also converted via metric units.

**Input:**\
Enter starting mileage:\
Enter ending mileage: \
Enter fuel at the start in Gallons: \
Enter fuel at the end in Gallons: 

## Program Output Example:
Enter starting mileage: 300\
Enter ending mileage: 650.45\
Enter fuel at the start in Gallons: 19\
Enter fuel at the end in Gallons: 2\
Number of miles traveled = 350.45\
Fuel used (gallons) = 17.00\
Miles per gallon of fuel = 20.61\
Number of kms traveled (1 mile = 1.609 km) = 563.87\
Fuel used (1 U.S. gallon = 3.785 liters) = 64.34\
Liters per 100kms = 11.41
